# **Weather Journal App**

This is a local web application that fetches the weather of the location of the zip code that is entered by the user, and captures what a user inputs in the "feelings" section and displays it in the "result" section using asynchronous JavaScript.

## **Installation**

All dependencies needed for development can be installed by running `npm install`

## **Usage** 

To start using the app, you can start up the server by running `npm run start` then open up a tab and go to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/), then you should enter a US zip code and describe the weather in the text area below the zip code input if you'd like, and press the generate button and your results will appear in the section below the button.
