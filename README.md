# **Weather Journal App**

This is a local web application that fetches the weather of the location of the zip code that is entered by the user using the [_Open Weather Map API_](https://openweathermap.org/api), and saves what a user inputs in the "Feelings" section and displays it in the "Results" section using asynchronous JavaScript.

## **Live Demo**

You can check out the Live version of the App [_here_](https://weather-journal-ash.onrender.com/).

## **Installation**

You can download all dependencies needed for development by running `npm install` in your terminal.

## **Running The Application**

To run the app locally, you can start up the server by running `npm run start` in your terminal, then navigate to [_localhost:3000_](http://localhost:3000/) using your browser, you can then enter a US zip code and describe the weather in the text area below the zip code input if you'd like, and press Generate and your results will appear in the section below the button.
